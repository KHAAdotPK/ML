Indicate Word Embedding Choice: Specify the library and model file you'll use.

Word Embedding Integration:

Library and Model: Inform me of the chosen library (Gensim/spaCy) and pre-trained model file (e.g., Word2Vec dimensions) for word embeddings.
Combination Method: Decide on how to combine word embeddings and position encoding (simple addition or learnable weights).

- Positional Encoding: This macro creates a matrix (pe) that captures the relative position of each word in the sequence. It uses sine and cosine functions to encode this information.
- Word Embeddings: These are pre-trained vector representations of words, learned from a large corpus. They capture the semantic meaning of words.

We'll integrate word embeddings separately from positional encoding.

Word Embedding Library and Model: Select your preferred library (Gensim or spaCy) and a pre-trained word embedding model file (e.g., Word2Vec with desired dimensions).

Combination Method: Choose how to combine word embeddings and position encoding (simple addition or learnable weights).

Training Your Own Word Embeddings:

Word2Vec or GloVe: These are popular word embedding algorithms you can implement yourself or use libraries like Gensim or spaCy that offer these functionalities. Here's a breakdown:

Word2Vec: Captures semantic relationships by predicting surrounding words based on a central word (CBOW) or vice versa (Skip-gram).
GloVe: Analyzes word co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus to learn word embeddings.
Training Data Considerations:

Size: The quality of your word embeddings depends on the size and diversity of your training data. Ensure your data is relevant to your sentiment analysis task.
Preprocessing: Clean your data by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying appropriate tokenization.
