# Word2Vec CBOW Implementation in C/C++

This repository contains code for the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model of Word2Vec. This is the initial push of the codebase to the repository.

## Description

The code previously functioned correctly. However, it is currently not operational due to changes in dependencies within their respective codebases, leading to interface modifications. In the near future, I plan to refactor the CBOW code to accommodate these changes.

## Note

Please be aware that the current version of the code is not functioning due to changes in dependencies. I am actively working on updating it to ensure proper functionality. Thank you for your patience.
